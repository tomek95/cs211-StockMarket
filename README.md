# stock_market_project
2nd year college project for Data Structures and Algorithms module.

Author: Tomasz Gawrysiak

Project Description:
Identify a string of natural numbers, each separated by a space, which minimizes volatility while staying below the investment amount available.
If your solution uses more money than you’re allowed, then you get 0%. (The limit will be given 2 hours before the time that the project is due at)
Your solution string must be the output of a program. If your solution uses less money than you’re allowed then you automatically get 40%.
The remaining 60% is decided by how volatile your solution is compared to everybody else’s.

Example solution string: 1 34 3 7 3 8 0 5…etc. (see below)

---------------------------------
Explained:
Given a table of nearly 500 companies and their stock prices for the years 2008-2011, you have to generate a string of natural numbers, where each number represents the number of units of a corresponding company that you want to buy. Given the limit of the investement (2 hours before the project is due), you have to find that string of numbers that will give you the lowest volatility.
